[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) is a popular, well-established, Christmas-themed event which releases a set of programming puzzles each December. Thousands of participants attempt, solve, and share solutions to these puzzles as a way to enjoy and expand their knowledge of programming.

This repository serves to host my solutions to puzzles I've attempted, in multiple languages. I've organised my solutions in a way that includes a cohesive executable, one for each language used, that allows for simple execution and output of solutions.
